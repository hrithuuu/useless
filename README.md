Project Description
This project is a two-in-one gaming WEBSITE that combines the timeless fun of Tetris with the thrill of a Maze Runner adventure. Players can switch between two distinct games in one platform, offering variety and engagement in a single package by filling your pockets.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How can we create a mindlessly addictive but completely pointless game that convinces greedy people to waste their time and chase fake rewards?

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We present "ARENA" ‚Äì a platform combining two classic but randomly frustrating games (Tetris + Maze Runner).The greed-driven players believe winning will unlock a promised big prize, but in reality, the ‚Äúreward‚Äù is just a digital sticker saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been played!‚Äù.
